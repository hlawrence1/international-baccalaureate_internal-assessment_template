# Electronic Light Switch

## Problem Question
How can you be sure the light switch is off without being in the room?

### Project Description

# Criterion A
## Scenario
My client is partly me, and the world. My design will enforce that the light switches are turned off when not needed remotley. It will save energy, and provide reassurance that the electricity bill is only what is needed. 

My advisor is Tristan, the reason I chose Tristan is because of her knowledge of coding and her experience with the assignment. She can also help me with designing the physical components.

The electronic light switch will be a small device with a motor and a sensor to make sure the light switch is off from a phone or a computer.
* Summarize your discussion with the client about their problem. Include details of what the client actually wants.

## Rationale

I will use GS because I am most familiar with it and it is relatively simple to use it for robotics. 
I will use Javascript because I am most familiar with it and it is relatively simple to use it for robotics.
* Justify your approach to solving the clientâ€™s problem. Justify your choice of software. Your argument must be specific, and directly related to the actual problem being solved.]

## Success Criteria
-test how the device can turn the lights off

# Interview

Henry: "I have this problem where I always forget to turn the lights off and leave the room. I wish there was a way where I can check to make sure im not wasting electricity and not having a big electricity bill."

Me: "Oh, really? Tell me more about that, please"]
